# Wedding Website

## About This Project  

This website was forked from [rampatra/wedding-website](https://github.com/rampatra/wedding-website) and customized to better suit my wedding needs. Several changes were made to enhance the RSVP system, guest management, and overall user experience.  

## Highlights

- **Fully responsive design** that works seamlessly across devices.
- **RSVP system** with Google Sheets integration for guest and plus-one management.
- **Validation code input** for guest verification before RSVP submission.
- **Automatic email notifications** when a guest RSVPs.
- **Custom guest experience** by allowing guests to check if they have a plus one.
- **Collection of guest preferences**, including attendance, dietary requirements, and drink choices.
- **Embedded YouTube video** showcasing the wedding venue.
- **Google Maps integration** to display the venue location.
- **Completely free to host**, using GitHub Pages for deployment and Google Sheets with Google Scripts for backend processing.
